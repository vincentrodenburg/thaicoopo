                            <p>The app is focussed around the freshly redesigned Disk Management Window. It acts as a hub for all the Mac drives connected to Windows. You will also be able to see your APFS or HFS+ drive directly within File Explorer, allowing easy integration with the rest of the Windows operating system. If you want to remove the Mac OS X 10.7 Lion “Recovery HD” partition, you’ll need to do a little bit of work because it’s a hidden partition. Hidden means it’s not just a matter of using your dual boot to go into 10.6 and then deleting it with Disk Utility. Quick Hey! So I have been using Paragon HFS+ for quite some time and overall it have worked well. I had pushed back the windows creators update for ages as I don't like being force to upgrade to something that reportedly had tons of issues. Eventually Windows updated itself while I was sleeping, and not long after my Sierra drive was corrupted. A TimeMachine backup got everything up and running in no time. Two months later and I faced a similar thing where nothing could repair the drive. Obviously. The Recovery partition in Mac OS X is an important component of a system install in that it allows you to troubleshoot a computer, repair drives, restore from backups, and even reinstall Mac OS if need be. Nonetheless, in some specific situations you may find that a Mac does not have a Recovery. I've got a 2010 iMac on the bench with a failing drive (uncorrectable bad sectors). Absolutely refuses to show up when connected to the system. I've docked it to a Windows system with the Bootcamp HFS driver installed, and am using Unstoppable Copier to transfer the entire contents of the drive to a working drive. My question is: Will Migration Assistant see the directory structure, and migrate all of the data, or will it fail to detect an install due to a missing bootloader, etc? Has anyone. Hey everybody, This might not be the best place but I thought I’d start here. My hackintosh recently crashed and can not get past the boot up. I’ve tried bunches of stuff and my final conclusion is just to wipe and reinstall. But I’ve got a couple very important files (not porn i promise) on that hard drive. I also have a PC on the same setup with a different hard drive. Does anybody know how i can access the hackintosh hard drive through pc and copy the files to an external Specifically regarding the recent Wannacry ransomware. 
I have windows and Mac OS X booting on two seperate SSDs, and then a data HDD of two terabytes. What filesystem do I use on that for easy file transfer across both with reliability. Hey all, I just bought a Macbook Pro. In case it's helpful, it's a 15" mid-2014 model.upgraded OS to Yosemite, 16gb ram, 2.8ghZ i7. I installed Windows 7 Ultimate (legit copy) using Bootcamp, and I can't seem to access my Mac partition from Windows. I did some Google searching, and a lot of people seemed to fix this by installing HFS drivers (even though I thought Bootcamp included that in the driver pack). Seems to be to no avail still. I can see the partition in Windows' Disk Management.  I'm attempting to move data from two MacBook Mac OSX Install Discs. Both for Mac OS version 10.5. I need to move the data from these bootable installation discs onto my windows machine so I can prepare a USB installation drive and then hook it up to my Mac machine. So I took install disc 1 and ran the DVD in my windows machine and was able to access the disc's data. I went then to install disc 2 and windows seems to be interpreting it as a blank disc and asking me to drag things to burn. I'm building a dual boot Hackintosh at the moment, OS X Yosemite and Windows 8.1. Right now everything works perfect. Each OS has its own SSD. Now i want to add a HDD and divide it into 2 partitions for each OS - HFS+ and NTFS. Easy i thought, just use OS X's Disk Utility, make a HFS+ and a FAT partition, switch to Windows and format that to NTFS. but Yosemite formatted the disk to a logical volume and the HFS+ partition to a logical partition (whatever that is), and the mac partition isn't. 
Hi, I have a toshiba 1tb HDD which I use with my MBP. But now my MBP is not working and I want to look into the HDD but when I connect it to my windows laptop, it connects (shows the safely remove option from bottom right) but doesn't show on My Computer. How do I access it? Is it a Fat32/NTFS issue. Hi everybody, as you can tell from the title, I am unwillingly running two bootloaders, namely `rEFInd` (being "higher up" in the hierarchy) and `grub`. Why is that? My laptop is a MacBook Pro, which I wanted to dual boot Archlinux and OSX with¹ Anyway. I followed some tutorials, which would usually suggest using `rEFInd` a bootloader when wanting to run anything other than OSX and Windows (which can be installed with `Bootcamp`). So I did that. Then I had a very hard time installing. Hey all, I've gotten two Kernel panics today - been working on an After Effects project, but nothing very graphically intensive render wise  Both are pretty similar, here's the most recent: Sat Apr 27 22:41:14 2019 \ \ \ Panic Report \ \ \ panic(cpu 0 caller 0xffffff80182897b4): "thread\_invoke: preemption\_level 1, possible cause: blocking while holding a spinlock, or within interrupt context"@/BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/xnu/xnu-4570.71.22/osfmk/kern/sched\_prim.c:22.

Warning: Long post incoming So, I am updating my cMP and would really like some advice/comments on my plan for upgrading. Here is some background: I have a 6-core 3,33GHz 4,1 upgraded to 5,1 with a GTX1060, 24GB RAM, 240GB PCIe SSD (the Macsales Accelsior one) as well as normal SSDs and spinning discs. On the MacOS side I do video editing (Premiere Pro), audio editing (Adobe Audition), general productivity (who am I kidding, it's just procrastination.) and a little bit of Photoshop 
I have a 2014 MacBook Pro with Mac OS and Windows 8.1 operating systems. Today I upgraded the Mac OS from 10.12 to 10.14 Mojave, therefore the file system of the Macintosh HD (the disk partition which Mac OS installed) changed from HFS to APFS. Before that, because I installed the bootcamp and drivers provided by Apple on the Windows, I can read files (read only) in Macintosh HD when I booted from Windows. However, I found now after the upgrade, when I booted from Windows, I could Ironically, I was writing this when it restarted. Let's try again. Since High Sierra was installed, I've experienced weird Bluetooth behaviour with the peripherals but now, a few updates later, my Mac freezes up and restarts. I just did ANOTHER SMC and PRAM reset, I've tried isolating hardwares and eHD, Safe Mode. I don't have a Time Machine setup. After this latest update, the systems feels slow too. If I leave it on at night, next morning I notice it has restarted. Here's some specs. Thanks in advance for your time. I'm trying to recover data for a friend from a 2000-something Macbook Pro. The original disk was swapped out for a 1TB drive, recognized as "HGST HTS 721010A9E630 SCSI Disk Drive". The original complaint was that the laptop "did no longer work" and had issues _somewhere_ during boot. It's possible this was at login into the OS, but also somewhere else in the boot sequence. I specifically asked if the laptop was dropped or had other shocks, which Hello , is this terminal command still works with latest High Sierra versions ? `"/Volumes/Image Volume/Install macOS High` `Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/startosinstall` (https://Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/startosinstall)`" --volume /Volumes/name_of_your_partition --converttoapfs NO` I'm trying to do clean install from USB , and I'm able to get to the screen where it asks me to \ agree to license \ but I'm not able to agree , the message says to agree type A and press. Ok so this has happened few many times now, I have one main SSD for Hackintosh then there is a HDD on which I clone/backup my MacOS and there is 1TB HDD which is used to store data (games, apps, large files etc) now this has happened at least 4 to 5 times within 2 months sometimes my main SSD crashes due to catalog file corruption sometimes the drive with stored data and now both my Clone drive and data drive are giving catalog file error and they are only repaired via Diskwarrior, I am really. For those who aren't aware of it, OS X El Capitan is the last operating system from Apple that uses HFS+ File System that is 20 years old. The new APFS (Apple File System) comes with a lot of improvements over the old and aging HFS, speed-wise and and security-wise. New encryption possibility, faster access and a lot of features imported from NTFS (Windows). Thing is: APFS was firstly introduced on macOS Sierra, and for the moment macOS Sierra is the only version capable of reading DMGs formatte. I was wondering if it was possible to extract data from my broken macbook (air mid-2013 SSD) using a PCI-e 4x adapter I found online (something like this: and then plug it into my PC motherboard (windows 8.1). Is it possible to then access the files using BootCamp drivers or something like HFS+ explorer? Otherwise, would it be possible to just plug in the SSD into another working macbook and extract the files. 
It's gone. I've been running Win10 in Bootcamp for a few months. Today I installed HFS+ for Windows by Paragon Software. I couldn't tell if it worked because corestorage kept me from seeing my mac HD. I reverted corestorage and everything worked fine. I have a Transcend JetDrive Lite in my SD card slot that I wanted to use as a data drive for Win10, but I couldn't even see the SD card in Windows or find the driver. Back into Mac, I went into Boot Camp Assistant to download the driver package. I recently upgraded to Sierra and also installed some updates for windows 10 in my bootcamp partition, the thing is that I can't read macintosh hd from bootcamp, and nor any other hfs+ drives. I've already reintalled bootcamp drivers and AppleHFS.sys and AppleMNT.sys with no success any advises I purchased the OWC SSD ( for my Macbook the other day. I heard that there were problems running Bootcamp on them. I did a bit of digging and found this (https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/2fy3be/by_popular_demand_my_better_than_bootcamp_guide/) guide by /u/5HT-2a for installing Windows 10 in full EFI Mode. I had to make a few changes for it to work with the 3rd party SSD. First things first, Before SOVED! now all working :) Hi, I need/want to install Windows10 x64 on a few old macbooks (air) that we have at work. Most of them are 2006 macbook2,1 ( but we also have a few 2008 macbook4,1 ( and 2009 macbookair2,1 (http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook-air/specs/macboo. Need to read a Mac drive on Windows? Here's how to access your Mac-formatted APFS or HFS+ drive on Windows. </p>
